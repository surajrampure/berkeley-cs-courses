This page features links to several Berkeley EECS course webpages with **publicly available resources** (lectures, homeworks, projects, etc.), with the purpose of consolidating resources for non-Berkeley students (or non-EECS Berkeley students) to visit. 

Links are from the most recent semester available (Spring 2019 for most courses, at the time of writing). Many courses have webcasts that are unavailable to non-Berkeley students, but in some cases, previous semesters of courses have video archives that are publicly available on YouTube. These are linked, when possible.

Refer [here](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/courses) for a complete listing of courses. 

At Berkeley, courses are labelled as either "lower division" or "upper division". Lower division courses typically cover a breadth of 

### Lower Division

At Berkeley, to declare the Computer Science major, students need to take three core courses to declare the major – CS 61A, CS 61B, and CS 70. These courses are also required for all EECS majors.

| Course | Title | Pre-Requisites | Resources Available | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CS 61A](http://cs61a.org) | Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs | N/A | slides, readings, assignments, [Fall 2018 lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIbldGLvZi8&list=PL6BsET-8jgYWAxSjQsIHKdks2Jl1TD1W0) | |
| [CS 61B](http://datastructur.es) | Data Structures | CS 61A (or similar) | slides, readings, assignments, lecture videos (public) | | 
| [CS 70](http://eecs70.org) | Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory | sophomore mathematical maturity | slides, readings, assignments |

We also have several other lower-division courses, covering a wide variety of topics. Courses marked with an asterisk (*) are required to complete the CS/EECS majors.

| Course | Title | Pre-Requisites | Resources Available | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Data 8](http://data8.org) | The Foundations of Data Science | N/A | slides, readings, assignments | often used to prepare for CS 61A; required for the new Data Science major |
| [CS 10](https://cs10.org/sp19/) | The Beauty and Joy of Computing | N/A | slides, readings, assignments | often used to prepare for CS 61A |
| [CS 61C](https://cs61c.org)* | Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures) | CS 61A, CS 61B | slides, readings, some assignments | some assignments are on edX |
| [EE 16A](http://ee16a.com)* | Designing Information Systems and Devices I | N/A | slides, readings, assignments | 2/3 linear algebra, 1/3 circuits |
| [EE 16B](http://ee16b.org)* | Designing Information Systems and Devices II | EE 16A, or another linear algebra course | slides, readings, assignments | linear algebra, and control theory |
